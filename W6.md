## Rotoscoping
to trace moving images. we need to seperate specific object from given plate. to make alpha channel.
Ultimate reason we use this : to make Alpha easier.   
seperate beizer part by elements ; ex. head, hoodie, clothes, bag, etc.   
we need to fisrt analyze how the object moves.   
### facial tracking   
there'll be dots on model's face, first we need to removee dots, then take each parts seperately.   
Rotoscoping is free from both occasional, locatinal limitation.   
tip: when you trace objest, you need to recognize where the camera is, which part of the object is more exposed.   
   
1. identify Motion path - not frame by frame   
2. seperate by objects   
3. stabilize plate - if it's not fixed shot, the things will go tough. so, you need to stabilize plate   
4. primary and secondary forms - you need to first know what moves how.   
6. use rotational points - imagine ball joint   
   
* make sure you check 'full size format', 'script directory'   
### relative directory 
" ./ " means same folder.   
" ../ " means higher folder.   
ex) 2 folder higher = ../../   
ex) 3 folders higher = ../../../   
project setting - script directory button   
just put the images in where nuke script is
