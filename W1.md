## COLOR
Basically color means a phenomenon of light.  
When the light hits an object then reflects right into our eye, we recognize this as color.   
> ### ALPHA
> What is Alpha? Digital devices only can show their color values by R, G, B, those three colors.   
> Then what about alpha? Alpha is a virtual color channel, which only exists in digital world.   
> Alpha as a color channel means opacity. When alpha is 1, it's translucent. When it's 0, it'd be transparent.   
   
## COLORSPACE   
With our human eyes, we are unable to see every color exists. Which means our eyesight that can recognize color is limited.   
But digital device can see what we can't. They can tell micro-different feature from one another.   
However, what really matters is that each device has their own way to express the color.   
For example, how TV expresses the color and how computer expresses is different.   
Colorspace is a graph shows us the range of color recognition of each formats.
